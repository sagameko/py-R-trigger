- Python â†” R Trigger Demo

This project demonstrates how to run R scripts from Python.
It provides a simple example where Python:

Calls an R script to transform a CSV file,

Reads the results back into Python, and

Triggers another R script that generates a basic text report.

This is a minimal but practical setup for testing workflows that mix Python and R.

- Features

Run R scripts from Python using subprocess.

Pass arguments from Python to R.

Capture and display live R logs inside the Python console.

Exchange data between Python â†” R via CSV files.

Generate reports from R and manage outputs with Python.

- Setup
Prerequisites

Python 3.10+

R (with Rscript.exe available)

Install dependencies
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

Point to Rscript

If Rscript isnâ€™t in your PATH, update run_r.py with the full path, e.g.:

RSCRIPT = r"C:\Program Files\R\R-4.4.2\bin\Rscript.exe"

- Run
python main.py


When it runs successfully, youâ€™ll see:

 Transformed CSV â†’ outputs/result_from_r.csv

 Snapshot report â†’ outputs/snapshot_report.txt

- Example Output

R version: R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31)

- Customization

Replace r_scripts/Snapshot_Report.R with your real R scripts.

Pass extra arguments to R by extending the run_r(...) calls in main.py.

Save results as CSV, Excel, or even render R Markdown reports.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

Useful for teams combining Python automation with R analytics/reporting.

Keeps R reproducible inside Python-driven pipelines.

Provides a clean, minimal starter template for hybrid Pythonâ€“R projects.
